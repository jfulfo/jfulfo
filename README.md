### Bio

Third-year CS & Math at UVA focused on programming languages and formal methods.
Working with [Wenxi Wang](https://wenxiwang.github.io/) on making program verification more accessible through better translation of verification conditions in Dafny.
Spent summer at Penn's [PL REU](https://penn-repl.github.io/) with [Steve Zdancewic](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/) developing parallel lambda calculus variants.

![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust,ocaml,haskell,c,cpp,py)

Building neural networks from scratch, working on real-time edge detection, and translating Z3 proofs into readable Dafny specifications.
Interested in type theory, programming language design, and making formal verification more accessible.

I solve Putnam problems, write proofs in LaTeX, and produce industrial music.
Running Arch.
Currently reading Moby Dick.
